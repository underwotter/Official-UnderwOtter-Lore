The histories and stories in this compendium are presented in English for the convenience of a human audience. It would be very difficult, bordering on impossible, to present these accounts in their original form in a manner legible to humans, since the phonetic structures of the original languages are so different from any existing human language. The wildly varying mouth and pharynx structures among the many animalistic species of {} led to many different and diverse languages; far more diverse than human languages on Earth, which have been constrained to a single species for all of history. Most of the languages of {} are species-specific, and are unpronounceable to other species, humans included.

These factors discussed above lead to some interesting historical trends, including the need for languages which many different species are able to speak. The modern Camari language, for example, originated as a creole language between High Camari (a feline language spoken in the heart of the Camari Empire), and the various languages spoken at the edge of the empire among various diverse taxonomic groups. The result was a compromise language which was mutually pronounceable among many different species. While most species would prefer to speak native languages among their own species, Camari was an attractive language for commerce, leading to its near-ubiquitous status throughout the archipelago.

The names of characters in these accounts have also been changed in order to be comprehensible by human readers. Though many creative liberties were taken for unique names, care was also taken to preserve word-play when relevant to the narrative. For example, Wulf Delmar's first name in its original form corresponds closely to the Camari word for wolves. As a result, I've chosen a Wolf/Wulf connection for this translation.
