## Summary

Binomial Name: _Acinonyx jubatus_
##### Subspecies:  

_Acinonyx jubatus jubatus_ (Mateka Cheetah)  
_Acinonyx jubatus venaticus_ (Kanzira Cheetah)  
##### Origin:
[[Mateka Island]] (Mateka Cheetah)  
[[Kanzira Island]] (Kanzira Cheetah)  
## History and Description

Cheetahs are divided into two subspecies: _A. jubatus jubatus_, and _A. jubatus venaticus_. The split was caused by two disparate cheetah populations becoming isolated after a land bridge between [[Mateka Island]] and [[Kanzira Island]] became submerged.

Cheetahs are the fastest running mammals, outpacing even many species of deer and antelope. However, unlike these species, cheetahs tire easily. As a result, cheetahs must train hard to build endurance to run for long periods of time.
