## Summary

Binomial Name: _Canis lupus_  
##### Origin:
[[Metridium Island]]
## History and Description

Wolves (Plural of Wolf) are a canine species native to [[Metridium Island]]. Wolves are hypothesized to be one of the first species to develop a sailing tradition, which led to disparate wolf populations appearing on many different islands, which would eventually diverge genetically from the [[Metridium Island]] Wolf population after the [[Pre-Voyaging Age Collapse]]. These populations would become the modern Dog Species.
