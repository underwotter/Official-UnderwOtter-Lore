## History and Description

Sea Otters evolved to have a very aquatic life cycle, likely living most of their lives in the ocean before the advent of recorded history. As a result of this, archeological evidence of Sea Otters can be found across the [[Torshova Group]]. Sea Otters have a very thick hide of fur, which protects them from the cold polar waters surrounding the islands [[Torshova Group]]. In fact, their fur is thick enough to prevent any water from reaching their skin. Sea Otters have very high metabolic requirements due to a fast metabolism which evolved to generate as much heat as possible. As a result, most Sea Otters tend to eat a lot during meals.
