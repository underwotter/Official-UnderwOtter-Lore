Archaeological evidence shows that there once were many more sapient species than are represented today. Among these are the majority of species composing *Rodentia*, which today is only represented by a handful of the largest members of the group, such as Capybaras, Beavers, and Porcupines. While these smaller mammals appear to have been abundant in pre-history, selective pressures favoring larger mammals appear to have slowly driven smaller species to extinction. A popular theory explaining this extinction event is the "Big Farmer Hypothesis," which posits that smaller species died out because they were simply too small to effectively adopt agriculture.

Additionally, there were many very large species as well, including the now-extinct Elephant, Giraffe, Rhinoceros, and Bison, among others. The existence of these species in early history is attested to in some of the earliest voyaging age texts, but it is believed that they died out because they were too large to sail, and were this out-competed by smaller animals.

Surviving mammalian groups appear to have homogenized in size over time to some extent. The archaeological record shows that, thousands of years ago, the small species of today were once smaller, and the larger species were larger. This phenomenon is believed to be due to selective pressures caused by mixed-species societies, which caused the size of species to eventually gravitate toward a mean average. This theory is supported by the fact that isolated groups of a small or large species are often smaller or larger respectively than contemporaneous members of the same species in mixed society.
