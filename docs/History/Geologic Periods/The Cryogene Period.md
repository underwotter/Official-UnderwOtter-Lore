## Summary

The Cryogene Period is a geologic period that lasted from 30 to 22 Million Years Ago. The period was marked by very low temperatures worldwide, which contributed a high degree of glaciation at the poles, and a subsequently low sea level worldwide. The low sea level revealed land passages between most of the world's islands, which was the primary factor contributing to [[The Great Mammalian Expansion]].
