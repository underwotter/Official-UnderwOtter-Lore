The Voyaging Age is a period of early history characterized by many different species creating sailing traditions, establishing trade, and developing the first writing systems. As the earliest historic texts come from this period, the Voyaging Age is typically regarded as the beginning of recorded history. Some species developed metalworking technologies during this time period, though most would still used stone weapons and tools for some time. The Voyaging Age began after a long period of little technological development following the [[Pre-Voyaging Age Collapse]].

Given that the Voyaging Age saw many different species interacting for the first time, there was a large amount of conflict. During the Voyaging age, predatory species would prey upon other sapient species for sustenance. However, the [[Ikiltu Covenant]] marked a shift in this paradigm, ending predation on [[Elk]] by [[Wolf|Wolves]] on [[Arcoba Island]]. Similar agreements would eventually appear across the world archipelago, effectively ending predation on other sapient species, and marking the end of the Voyaging Age.
