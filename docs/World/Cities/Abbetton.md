## Description

Abbetton is an old city located on [[Tecozin Island]]. The city is built on swampland, and has historically had difficulty in keeping the city above the swamp. However, modern water level engineering has largely eliminated this weakness. Abbetton is considered to be the birthplace of [[The Federated Island Republics of Lorenzia]], as it is the city where the revolution broke out, which would eventually lead to the formation of the country.

Abbetton is the home town of [[Danny Weaver]].
