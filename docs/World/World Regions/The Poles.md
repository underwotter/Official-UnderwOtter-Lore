Polar waters are officially designated as regions which are north of the [[Ekleiptic of Lycaos]] at 65.5 degrees north, or south of the [[Ekleiptic of Aetos]] at 65.5 degrees south. The region surrounding the north pole is the {}, and the region surrounding the south pole is the Ant{}. During the winter in these regions, there is a period when the sun never rises above the horizon, and in the summer, there is a period where the sun never sets, though the sun never rises far above the horizon at any time of year.

Ships rarely venture into polar waters, due to the danger of sea ice collisions. As a result, most maritime trade occurs within the Ekleiptics and the Tropics, and fringe settlements outside of the Ekleiptics in polar water generally do not grow to a large size. A notable exception is {}, which is the largest city in polar waters.
