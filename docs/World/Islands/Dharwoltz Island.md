Country: [[{Germany}]]
Island Group: [[Dharwoltz Group]]
## Description

Dharwoltz Island is a moderately large island in [[{Germany}]], and the largest island of the [[Dharwoltz Group]].

The Island is home to the Dharwoltzland, a large area of very fertile farmland, which has made the island coveted by many countries throughout history. Disputes over the ownership of the Dharwoltzland between [[The Volkovian Federation|The Volkovian Empire]] and [[{Germany}]] led to the outbreak of [[The Sixty Years' War]], which began with the [[The Battle of {} Bridge]] on Dharwoltz Island. Today, a monument stands on both sides of the bridge as a memorial to the millions of lives lost in [[The Sixty Years' War]].
