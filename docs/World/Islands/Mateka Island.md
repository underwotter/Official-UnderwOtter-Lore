## Summary

Country: [[Caracca]], [[Samdara]], [[North Fazara]]  
Island Group: [[Mateka Group]]  
## Description

Mateka Island is the largest Island in the world. Unlike most islands which are claimed by a single country, three different countries lay claim to territory on Mateka Island: [[Caracca]], [[Samdara]], and [[North Fazara]]

Most of the island is covered in grasslands and savannas, with several notable but isolated volcanic peaks in the island. The climate is hot and dry, though the windward coast of the sails has a pleasant tropical climate, and is a popular vacation area.
