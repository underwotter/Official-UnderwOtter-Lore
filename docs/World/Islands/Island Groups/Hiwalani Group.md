## Description

The Hiwalani group's history is largely associated with [[Kawatochi]], which claimed ownership over the island since at least 371. However, several islands in the group were conquered and annexed by [[The Federated Island Republics of Lorenzia]] during the latter years of the Sixty Years' war. 

The island group is characterized by a hot tropical climate. Frequent rain facilitates the growth of dense jungles carpeting the lower elevations throughout the island group. The islands in the Hiwalani group are ubiquitously volcanic, and formed relatively recently in terms of geologic time. The highest point on Loama, [[Mauna 'Uhane]], can be found on [[Hiwalani Island]]
