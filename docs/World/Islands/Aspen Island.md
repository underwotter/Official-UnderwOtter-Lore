## Summary

Country: [[The Federated Island Republics of Lorenzia]]  
Island Group: [[Moffat Group]]  
## Description

Aspen Island is a moderately-sized temperate island situated in the [[Moffat Group]], and belongs to [[The Federated Island Republics of Lorenzia]]. The Island is mostly uninhabited, although there are several small towns nestled among the mountains. The Island's largest city is [[Stirling]], which has a population of just above 2500. A tall mountain range makes up nearly the entirety of the island, and dense pine and aspen forests cover all but the tallest mountains. However, the leeward side of the island has lower precipitation, and thus has several open prairies between the mountains.
