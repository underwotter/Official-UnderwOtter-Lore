## Description

Atlas Island is an artificial island situated offshore from Metridium Island. The Island was constructed to act as the anchor for the [[Atlas Space Elevator]], and is home to labs, administrative buildings, and even a small fusion reactor to support the Atlas Project. Most of the island is covered by the Atlas Island Pavillion, which is the second-tallest artificial structure in the world, second only to the elevator tether itself.

The Island is a condominium under international law, shared equally between [[The Federated Island Republics of {The United States of America}]], [[The Volkovian Federation]], and [[{Japan}]]. The Island is not a Federal Island District for [[The Federated Island Republics of {The United States of America}]].

Security on the Island is contracted to the Lassen Corporation, which is headquartered in Arcadia on Metridium Island.
