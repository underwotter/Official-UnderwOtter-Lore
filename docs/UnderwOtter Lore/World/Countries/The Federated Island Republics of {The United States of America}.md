## History

{The United States of America} was officially established on 08 {Month12}, 1198, as a union of seven Islands.

## Government
{The United States of America} is currently composed of 85 Island Districts. Most districts are composed of a single island, with some exceptions: Uninhabited or sparsely populated islands are generally aliased to the nearest inhabited island district, and several of the largest Islands in the country are split into two or more districts.

Each Island District elects two senators to the [[Federal Congress of the {}]], which is conducted in the Capitol City of [[{Washington D.C.}]] on [[{} Island]]. Senators are elected to ten-year terms, with individual elections being staggered to occur every five years.
