## {The Sun}

## {The Moon 1}

{The Moon 1} is the larger of two moons orbiting {}.
## {The Moon 2}

{The Moon 2} is the smaller of two moons orbiting {}. Given its small size and distance from {}, it appears as little more than a point of light in the sky, similar to the other planets in the solar system. Nevertheless, astronomers since ancient times recognized it as a second moon, due to the regularity of its movement through the sky. Modern astronomical observations have revealed a structure very similar to that of transient asteroids; therefore, it is believed that {Moon 2} is an asteroid captured by {}'s gravity

## Archa

Archa is a series of thin rings encircling {}, and are believed to be the remnants of a small third moon that was broken apart by tidal forces approximately 2.7 billion years ago. Though nearly invisible during the daytime, the rings appear as a bright white arc across the night sky, immediately after sunset and before sunrise when the rings can be illuminated by {The Sun}. Archa lies directly above the equator, making it an important navigational tool; Archa will always lie in the south when you are in the northern hemisphere, and it will always be in the north when you are in the southern hemisphere. Due to its relatively low altitude, Archa is not visible at latitudes greater than 56 degrees.
