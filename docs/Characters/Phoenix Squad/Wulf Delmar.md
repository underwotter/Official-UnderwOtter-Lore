## Biography

Wulf Delmar was born in [[Port Morgan]] on [[Kokotak Island]] in [[The Federated Island Republics of Lorenzia]]. Wulf's Parents were recent immigrants from [[The Democratic Volkovian Union]], and did not know much of the Camari language at the time of Wulf's birth. They named Wulf after a Camari poem they were familiar with which featured a Wolf, not knowing that it was the name of an entirely different species. Afterward, a transliteration error from Volkovian to Camari resulted in the name Wulf.
