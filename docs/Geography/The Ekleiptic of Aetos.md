The Ekleiptic of Aetos lies at 65.5 degrees South, and is the point at which, on the winter solstice, the sun never rises above the horizon. As one moves further north, the period of the year during which the sun does not rise above the horizon becomes longer. The region south of the Ekleiptic of Aetos, which surrounds the geographic south pole, is called the Antkunavic, as it is the opposite of the Kunavic. Most of the Antkunavic is open sea, and therefore sees very little maritime traffic.
