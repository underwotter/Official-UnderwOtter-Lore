The Ekleiptic of Lycaos lies at 65.5 degrees north, and is the point at which, on the winter solstice, the sun never rises above the horizon. As one moves further south, the period of the year during which the sun does not rise above the horizon becomes longer. The region north of the Ekleiptic of Lycaos, which surrounds the geographic north pole, is called the Kunavic. While there are island groups throughout the Kunavic, the rough seas characteristic of very high latitudes precludes most maritime traffic. However, there are some populated islands straddling the Kunavic side of the Ekleiptic of Lycaos, such as [[Torshova Island]] and [[Kokotak Island]].
